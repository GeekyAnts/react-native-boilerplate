# React Native Boilerplate

### This Repo is deprecated

This repo is a boilerplate for your next React Native project. It is based on the source code of the official [F8](https://fbf8.com/) app of 2016.

## Redux + CodePush included

Redux is the de-facto of state management in React apps. Microsoft's CodePush is amazing and it is included out-of-the-box in the app. Relay has been removed as most of the API services still use REST.
